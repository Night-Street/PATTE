## 题干

Werewolf（狼人杀） is a game in which the players are partitioned into two parties: the werewolves and the human beings. Suppose that in a game,

- player #1 said: "Player #2 is a werewolf.";
- player #2 said: "Player #3 is a human.";
- player #3 said: "Player #4 is a werewolf.";
- player #4 said: "Player #5 is a human."; and
- player #5 said: "Player #4 is a human.".

Given that there were 2 werewolves among them, at least one but not all the werewolves were lying, and there were exactly 2 liars. Can you point out the werewolves?

Now you are asked to solve a harder vertion of this problem: given that there were N players, with M werewolves among them, at least one but not all the werewolves were lying, and there were exactly L liars. You are supposed to point out the werewolves.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integer N (5 ≤ N ≤ 100), M and L (2 ≤ M，L < N). Then N lines follow and the i-th line gives the statement of the i-th player (1 ≤ i ≤ N), which is represented by the index of the player with a positive sign for a human and a negative sign for a werewolf.

### Output Specification:

If a solution exists, print in a line in descending order the indices of the M werewolves. The numbers must be separated by exactly one space with no extra spaces at the beginning or the end of the line. If there are more than one solution, you must output the largest solution sequence -- that is, for two sequences A = { a[1], ..., a[M] } and B = { b[1], ..., b[M] }, if there exists 0 ≤ k < M such that a[i] = b[i] (i ≤ k) and a[k+1]>b[k+1], then A is said to be larger than B. In case there is no solution, simply print `No Solution`.

### Sample Input 1:

```in
5 2 2
-2
+3
-4
+5
+4
```

### Sample Output 1:

```out
4 1
```

### Sample Input 2:

```in
6 2 3
-2
+3
-4
+5
+4
-3
```

### Sample Output 2:

```out
6 4
```

### Sample Input 3:

```in
6 2 5
-2
+3
-4
+5
+4
+6
```

### Sample Output 3:

```out
No Solution
```

## 题目大意

N名玩家坐在一起玩狼人杀(编号为1到N)，其中有M人是狼人。现在给出某一轮各玩家的发言，每名玩家都会声称在场某玩家的身份是好人(**用"+"表示**)或狼人(**用"-"表示**)。已知此轮发言中恰好有L人说谎(其发言与事实不符)，且**至少有一名狼人说谎但并非所有狼人都说谎**。请判断哪些玩家是狼人，降序输出他们的编号。**如果有多解，输出最大序列解；如果无解，输出No Solution**。

## 本题考察知识点

- 深度优先搜索(**D**epth **F**irst **S**earch, **DFS**)

## 解题思路

本题与 [A1148](https://pintia.cn/problem-sets/994805342720868352/problems/1038429808099098624) 如出一辙，只是要考虑的因素变多了：多了**狼人数**和**说谎人数**这两个参数。但这两题的思路都是一样的：DFS列举所有可能的狼人组合，然后分别判断每个组合的合法性(是否符合题目要求)。

判断合法性的过程如下：

1. 遍历一遍所有人说过的话，并根据目前的狼人组合筛选出说谎的玩家。
2. 判断说谎玩家数量是否为L。
3. 判断说谎的狼人数量是否在[1,M)范围内。

由于题目要求**输出最大序列解**，所以直接从编号最大的玩家处开始搜索。也就是说，如果有5名玩家，且其中有3名狼人的话，那么应该假设狼人组合为(5,4,3),(5,4,2),(5,4,1),(5,3,2),(5,3,1)...，按照这样的方式进行搜索。一旦搜索到合法解就结束算法。
